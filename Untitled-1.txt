# Ideas:

Alarm clock: 
You can use the Yeelight bulb as an alarm clock by gradually increasing the brightness and changing the color over a set period of time.
This can make waking up in the morning a more pleasant experience.

Weather notification:
You can use a weather API to get the current weather conditions and use the Yeelight bulb to display the weather through different colors or patterns.

Motion detection:
You can use a motion sensor to trigger the Yeelight bulb to turn on or change color when someone enters the room.
This can create a cool and interactive lighting experience.

Sunrise/sunset simulation:
You can use the Yeelight bulb to simulate a sunrise or sunset by gradually changing the color and brightness over a set period of time.
This can create a relaxing and soothing ambiance in your home.
